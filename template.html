]]Text
Falling footsteps in the distance could be heard as someone was running, searching for a place to hide. Tap tap tap tap tap, a not rhythmic sound as someone clearly not physically fit was trying to run away and hide. > > >
]]Text
Not far away, a patrol of imps, a minor type of voidsent was desperately searching for this fleeing woman.

“Where did she go!?”

]]Text
“You were the one that had her restrained, ~~YOU~~ tell me where she went!”
]]Portrait
Arkeisios
]]Text
“She just disappeared right in front of my eyes, she just ‘Vanish’ed!”
]]Portrait
Minos
]]Text
Frustrated, the squad leader silenced the troops. “SILENCE! If we don’t re-capture her after dragging her into the void, the Emperor will have us ‘disintegrated’. As Minos spoke his voice trembled slightly in fear.
]]Portrait
Narrator
]]Text
The two Imps looked to each other, a pin drop could be heard in the sudden silence as the squabble ended just then. A scout Imp came rushing towards the group.
]]Portrait
Sithon
]]Text
“There you are, I have been searching all over for you. Ophellia says she is ready for soul extraction so you had better hurry and take the captured woman to the castle… wait, where is she?” >>>
]]Text
Sithon was seemingly exhausted from rushing so quickly that it just then noticed the situation.
]]Portrait
Minos
]]Text
“It seems she was more resourceful than we were told, she used some trick to escape.” Minos then sent up a flare to put all nearby patrols on alert. “We will find her, the Emperor will still have her soul.”
]]Portrait
Sithon
]]Text
Snorting in disgust “Useless soldiers, you had better hope you find her, if you don’t you will be lucky if the Emperor only has you killed, it is more likely he will allow Ophellia to experiment on you, >>> 
]]Text
she has gotten very good at creating Chimera out of damned voidsent from what I saw, although it is clear they suffer."
]]Portrait
Minos
]]Text
“Lets split up to search, send up a flare when you find her, you two go that way and Sithon you come with me.”

Meanwhile, not far away, the woman they were searching for found a moment of respite hiding in an area behind some purplish-black crystal growth. She was quite winded and was struggling to catch her breath.
]]Portrait
Eva_Standard
]]Text
Whirling around to scan the immediate surroundings. "Current Location unknown… Warning! Seven thousand low tier voidsent detected in immediate vicinity, three voidsent not able to be quantified also in vicinity…"  > > >
]]Text
"Immediate evacuation recommended… request instructions.” The machine blurted, glowing red as it continued to perform its scan of the new surroundings.
]]Portrait
Lily_Tired
]]Text
Still gasping for air, the woman put her back to the crystal and then slid down to sit for a moment. “Haaaa….. So you don't….. Know where.....we are?” 
]]Text
She almost cried from the silliness of that statement. She took a moment to catch her breath. 
]]Portrait
Lily_Standard
]]Text
“Silly Eva, we are in the void, the thirteenth shard of our world, we got sucked into the aetherial tear” 
]]Portrait
Lily_Ponder
]]Text
She considered for a moment. “Eva, report on your aether reserves, do you have enough to help me open a new tear?” 
]]Portrait
Lily_Explain
]]Text
I should need perhaps eighty percent of your maximum, and if you help me we can open a way home for us.”
]]Portrait
Eva_Standard
]]Text
Eva was the designation of the node that was assisting the mage. “Aether reserves at seventy one percent, full usage will result in extended shutdown of this unit pending recharge.”
]]Portrait
Lily_Ponder
]]Text
Lily pondered, tapping her knuckle to her chin as she considered. “See if you can charge from these crystals here Eva, disable your protection circuits if you have to we need you to get that aether quickly” 
]]Portrait
Lily_Standard
]]Text
Lily was nervous when she suggested that, it was actually quite a risk to Eva, but she saw no other options to charge the Node.
]]Scene

Sithon
]]Text
Sithon was floating along with the patrol “They managed to capture her in the void gate, how did they let her escape!”. Once again, she was cursing the patrol of soldiers.
]]Portrait
Minos
]]Text
 “The woman has some control over darkness and overcame her captors. It's why master wants to capture her dead or alive doesn't matter really, he just needs a taste of her aether, > > >
]]Text
although it is preferable to extract her soul for future use.”
]]Portrait
Sithon
]]Text
 “So you're saying we can feast a little bit and just have to take back a piece, it has been long since I have tasted living aether.”
]]Portrait
Narrator
]]Text
In the distance, some sparking can be heard and an excited shout from a woman perhaps.
]]Portrait
Sithon
]]Text
 “Over there!”, the young imp immediately charged over. Sithon was a research aide, not a soldier and had no mind for tactics.
]]Portrait
Minos
]]Text
 “Careful to not engage her alone! She already escaped once!” Minos grumbled, Sithon had already scolded his unit and now was going to alert his prey to their approach. > > >
]]Text
Since she was charging ahead of him, he had no choice but to send up a flare instead of investigating the situation first.
]]Scene

Eva_Charged
]]Text
Eva dropped to the floor after a rapid charge, electric sparks discharging here and there from the node’s chassis.
]]Portrait
Lily_Alert
]]Text
Lily shouted “EVA!! Get up, That is surely enough for us to go” She was worried the loud noise would alert searchers to her location.
]]Portrait
Eva_Standard
]]Text
Eva’s chassis lights flashed briefly before the node floated again. “Unit charge 81%, remaining bank was overloaded.”
]]Portrait
Sithon
]]Text
Sithon appeared at that moment; “Mortal Woman, your aether belongs to us now.”  Sithon charged in abruptly, but then realized she had no idea what to do, > > >
]]Text
and so instead Sithon began preparing herself with Ice Spikes armor. 
]]Image
S_Lily_Attacked
]]Portrait
Minos
]]Text
Seeing the situation ahead, Minos decided he must act quickly to remove the chance of her escape again. Without warning its eye flashes red and it used ‘Level 5 Petrify’.
]]Portrait
Lily_Scared
]]Text
Lily and Eva quickly moved out of the way. “EEEE, you could have killed me!” Lily brandished her staff, which glowed black and purple as it had been long ago imbued with dark power. 
]]Text
“Allagan Fire!” She set voidsent the voidsent ablaze, at a temperature high enough its flesh began to melt, the beast expired immediately. 
]]Portrait
Lily_Alert
]]Text
“This way Eva, let's open an aetherial tear here and go home.” Lily began running full speed with Eva just beside her.
]]Portrait
Sithon
]]Text
Sithon froze for a moment, before she began shouting. “She is here!!” And began charging after Lily, more confident now that Ice Spikes was giving her some protection.
]]Image
S_Lily_Run
]]Portrait
Lily_Scared
]]Text
Panting, Lily was using up almost all of her aether to start opening a tear to get back to the source as she ran 
]]Text
“Now EVA, the tear is started, supplement it with the Aether you have.”
]]Portrait
Eva_Standard
]]Text
Eva beeped an affirmative tone, and discharged a pulse of aether into the tear Lily started to open. 
]]Text
The lights on the Node shut off and the machine expended all its remaining energy into the task.
]]Portrait
Lily_Scared
]]Text
Lily shouted “EVA! Oh no you dont!” She caught EVA as the node fell, and leapt into the aetherial tear. 
]]Portrait
Lily_Alert
]]Text
Expecting to find herself back in her ship and once again guarded by her machine guardians. She thought herself quite clever to escape back to safety…
